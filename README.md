# PRODIGY_WD_01

 I’ve successfully completed Task 1 of my internship at Prodigy Infotech, where I worked on creating an interactive navigation menu.
Technologies Used:
HTML for structuring the navigation menu
CSS for styling, including advanced gradients, animations, and responsive layouts
JavaScript to add interactivity, like changing background colors and scroll effects
Through this task, I gained valuable hands-on experience in building interactive UI components and learned how to implement animations and smooth transitions. I’m looking forward to completing the next tasks and continuing to develop my front-end skills throughout this internship.
